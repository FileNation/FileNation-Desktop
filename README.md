_The simplest way to send unlimited files around the world_

### Steps
Please keep in mind that a message as the one you can see below might appear after downloading (releases) and trying to open the FileNation desktop application. This is common whenever downloading an application from a source different than the official AppStore.

Do not worry, our application is virus-free, so the way to work around this is:

    Please open your finder
    Go to your applications folder
    Double-click on the FileNation application icon
    A pop up will appear, click Open

If you have any issues at all, please reach us out via twitter @filenation_io or email hello@filenation.io

### Feedback 

The best thing to do in case you stumble upon a bug is to open an issue, attaching a screenshot and a copy of the logs describing the error. Moreover, a description of the steps required to reproduce the error would be fantastic!
